Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) 
---------------------------------------------

This repository tackles the issue of Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) through the study of harmonic function solutions (HFS). Detailed explanations on the theory can be found in the handout file, as well as answers in the report file. An application to face recognition is also studied. The handout contains a third part on Online Face Recognition, but this topic is so cool that it deserves the creation of another repository. (If interested, see my repo online-face-recognition.)

Required libraries and datasets
------------------------------------------

It is not mandatory, but you can download the data folder https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pasw5gbhr1mhc9y/AABmCYweSneew3YB2ICQ2ZR2a?dl=0 and put it in /data to have more enlightening results.

See file `requirements.txt` for the required libraries.
